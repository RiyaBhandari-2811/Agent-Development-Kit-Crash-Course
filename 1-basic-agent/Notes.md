# Explanation  of ADK Components

## **1. `__init__.py`**

**What it is:**

A special Python file that turns a directory into a  *package* .

**Why it’s needed:**

When ADK (Agent Development Kit) scans for available agents, it looks for importable modules. Without `__init__.py`, your folder isn’t recognized as a Python package  so ADK wouldn’t be able to “see” your agent.

**In short:**

1. Makes your agent *discoverable*
2. Defines the structure for ADK’s automatic loading

---

## **2. `agent.py`**

**What it is:**

This is the “main brain” of your agent  the file where you define how your agent behaves and interacts with ADK.

**Why it’s needed:**

ADK looks for a special variable called `root_agent` inside `agent.py`. This variable is like your agent’s identity card  it tells ADK what model to use, how to behave, and which tools it can access.

**In short:**

1. Central definition of your agent
2. Entry point for ADK to run it

---

## **3. Commands**

**What they are:**

ADK provides a command-line interface (CLI)  similar to how Node.js has `npm` or Python has `pip`.

**Why they matter:**

Running commands like `adk web` or `adk run` from the *parent directory* ensures that ADK can properly detect the structure and find your agent.

If you run commands *inside* the agent folder, ADK won’t know where the parent structure is, and discovery will fail.

**In short:**

1. Always execute from the parent directory
2. Ensures correct auto-discovery of your agent

---

## **4. Identity (`name` & `description`)**

**What it is:**

Metadata that gives your agent a unique personality and purpose.

**Why it matters:**

ADK can orchestrate multiple agents. The `name` uniquely identifies one, while `description` helps others decide whether to delegate tasks to it.

**In short:**

1.  Makes the agent identifiable
2. Enables clear routing and collaboration between agents

---

## **5. Model (`model`)**

**What it is:**

Specifies the underlying LLM (Large Language Model) your agent runs on.

**Why it matters:**

Different models have different strengths  some are faster and cheaper (e.g., “gemini-2.0-flash”), others more powerful and reasoning-oriented.

**In short:**

1. Defines your agent’s “intelligence level”
2. Controls performance, cost, and behavior quality

---

## **6. Instructions (`instruction`)**

**What it is:**

The “soul” of your agent  a detailed prompt that shapes its tone, behavior, and purpose.

**Why it matters:**

Instructions guide *how* the model should think, act, and respond. Without it, your agent is just a blank model with no defined role.

**In short:**

1. Defines *personality* and *goal*
2. Controls tone, structure, and decision boundaries

---

## **7. Tools (`tools`)**

**What they are:**

External functions or APIs that your agent can use to extend its capabilities beyond the LLM’s native knowledge.

**Why they matter:**

LLMs can’t access real-time data or perform actions on their own. Tools bridge that gap  letting your agent fetch APIs, run Python functions, or interact with external systems.

**In short:**

1. Extends your agent’s abilities
2. Allows interaction with real-world systems

---

## Run Your Agent

From the  **parent directory** , execute:

```bash
adk web
```

or

```bash
adk run
```
